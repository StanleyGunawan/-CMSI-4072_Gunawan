Project Proposal Feedback
Project: self-learning chess
=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
   Verbal Description
      You effectively explain that you will build a chess application with
      an integrated AI opponent, using a neural network, a minimax algorithm
      and self-play to generate a decision tree and training data.  You
      provide a clear identification of the target user and you have a clear
      use of technical language and understanding of that.  The document
      could be improved by including details about the user interface or
      the final product quality.

   Justification:
      You show strong tie to relevant coursework, and a solid explanation of
      why the project is meaningful.  You give evidence of relevant technical
      experience, and provide a realistic reflection on feasibility of the
      project.  This section could be made stronger by providing a more
      explicit link to software-engineering practices


Proposal Presentation [Slides and video] [3 points]:
   Slides:
      VERY nice work on the slides.  The color scheme is nice and the
      titel slide is cool!  Try to use less text in your bullets so that
      the audience doesn't have to read and can focus more on what you are
      saying.
