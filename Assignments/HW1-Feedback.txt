SPECIFIC COMMENTS:

Problem 1.1 ~ correct

Problem 1.2 ~ correct

Problem 2.4 ~ correct

Problem 2.5 ~ correct

Problem 4.2 ~ correct

Problem 4.4 ~ Gantt chart doesn't have enough granularity of the dates to be
   able to tell what the start and finish dates are and when holidays and
   weekends fall in the schedule.  Nice looking chart, though...

Problem 4.6 ~ correct

Problem 4.8 ~ correct

Problem 5.1 ~ correct

Problem 5.3 ~ An audience-oriented classification is attempted, but several
   items are miscategorized:
   (e) “schedule at any time,” (f) “allow to run at any time,” (h) sequential
      execution, and (i) waiting behavior are functional behaviors, not
      nonfunctional qualities.
   (a) “monitor while away from the office” is best labeled user + functional,
      not purely business.
   (g) “= 8 Mbps” is correctly nonfunctional (performance).

Problem 5.9 ~ the Must item focuses on monetization rather than core
   gameplay/UX improvements, and Won’t uses “could have,” which muddles the
   category intent.


nice work!
