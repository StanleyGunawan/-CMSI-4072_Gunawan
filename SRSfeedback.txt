Software Requirements Specification
Initial Development Schedule
CMSI 4072 Spring 2026
=======================================

COMPONENT BREAKDOWN:
   Strengths:
      Components are explicitly named (GUI, Move Validation, Self-Learning
         NN, Database, File Handler), aiding traceability from structure to
         requirements.
   Suggestions:
      Add short assumptions and constraints (e.g., single-user local
         play only, no online matchmaking, RL training on-device vs. offline).
      Include a context/sequence diagram (user -> GUI -> move validation ->
         engine -> DB/file I/O) to reinforce “clear and agreed-upon.”
      Provide a brief glossary (e.g., PGN, “standard matches”,
         “reinforcement learning episode”) to remove ambiguity.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
   Strengths:
      Requirements are atomic, testable, and mapped to components, which
         supports verification and traceability.
   Suggestions:
      Add error/edge-case flows: illegal drag attempts, corrupted or
         malformed PGN, mid-game save failure, unsaved-changes prompts, and
         recovery after app crash.
      Clarify rules scope (castling rights, en passant, threefold
         repetition, insufficient material). “FIDE rules” can be expanded into
         explicit, testable clauses..pdf)
      Specify user controls for engine difficulty or time controls
         (fixed depth, time per move), and whether undo/redo is allowed.
      Define data governance details: what “context for decision making”
         means in the DB; retention of game histories; export/import formats
         beyond PGN if any..pdf)
      If learning occurs locally, add a toggle to run with or without
         learning updates; define model reset and versioning behavior.

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
   Strengths:
      User-centred timings align with perceived responsiveness for turn-based
         play and GUI interaction.
   Suggestions:
      Add range distributions for timings to ensure
         consistency under load (e.g., large opening books, long game files).
      Define resource ceilings tied to performance (max CPU usage %, max
         RAM usage during analysis), and fallback policies (reduce search
         depth when exceeding time budget).
      Add startup time and model-load time targets; specify budget for
         saving autosave snapshots..pdf)
      Include stress scenarios: deep endgames, complicated positions, and
         very large PGN files, with expected performance envelopes.

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS:
   Strengths:
      Concrete OS, language, and library declarations improve repeatability.
   Suggestions:
      Add package version pins (TensorFlow minor/patch), and a
         dependency management approach (pip/venv/Conda) plus a
         reproducible build process.
      Clarify GPU usage (CPU-only vs. optional CUDA), and required
         drivers if GPU acceleration is supported..pdf)
      Include data directories and permissions (where PGN and model
         weights live), and backup/export expectations..pdf)
      Note test frameworks and CI/CD (if any) for development
         environment completeness.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
You've met most of the desired measurements for this deliverable.  Your SRS
is very well done but could benefit from at least incorporating a few of
the suggestions to make it even more complete, such as making rules and edge
cases explicit, Complete environment detail, and Improve clarity and shared
vocabulary.

Nice work on this deliverable ~ keep up the good work!
